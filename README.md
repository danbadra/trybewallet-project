With a focus on the use of Redux and Redux Thunk, Trybewallet is a React Application created for recording foreign expenses, converting them to the Brazilian Real at the current exchange rate using an API that changes rates in real time. It also generates an expense table with the user's transaction's history, where it is possible to edit, delete, and add more expenses.
